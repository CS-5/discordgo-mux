# disgomux
A multiplexer for DiscordGo

### Why choose this over any other DiscordGo Mux?
You really shouldn't, but if you're considering it, here are a few reasons I think mine is cool.

- It makes use of interfaces to have fine-tuned control over how command handlers are managed.
- It has support for custom loggers
- It's reasonably straightforward to understand
- It supports `help` commands quite nicely.
- An example of it in action can be found [here](https://github.com/PulseDevelopmentGroup/0x626f74)
